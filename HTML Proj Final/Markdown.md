For this final submission I primarily touched up some final details and organized code. I cleaned up some spacing with code. The primary thing was finishing the Event page. On the event page I added 2 links both linking to their respective event being Flex on Em and Flex on Em 2.  I also added small descriptions to each poster image as well as adding a sendto in the href for the contact us section at the bottom.
