In this final draft I mainly did three things; update the mission statement page, Create the home page, and create the events page. For the home page I used articles to create large link boxes for both of the other screens for the project. I also added a get started button that scrolls you down to the main section of the homepage. In the Events page, I added the image for the current event and then some text explaining the event. Next I'll add the links for the events and a little description for each. For the Mission Statement page I just added some text and cleaned some stuff up.
