In this preview I set up a basis for my home page with navigation tools pretty much everywhere. I created a menu bar that will take the user to any of the three connected pages. I plan on creating an event page and then a page with an about me and information on how to donate to the charities we support. The next thing I did was create a coherent layout to foster my home page. I went with a modern design with contact us info on the bottom then the main information in the middle including more links to the other pages. I set up a form to work as the contact us page. It doesn't actually submit anything anywehere but I could set it up to if need be but for this project it will not be necessary. I also added my twitter in the contact information since I do a lot of business for these tournaments via twitter. Finally, I set up the other pages and just have to finish creating them.
